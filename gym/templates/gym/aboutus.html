    <h1>History</h1>
    <h2>2002â€“2004: Background and founding</h2>
    <p>
        Chucky Runyon, Dave Mortensen, and Jeff Klinger first met in the early 1990s while working for a fitness club in
        St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1995, they jointly purchased and ran Southview Athletic Club for seven years. During
        their ownership of the club, its membership rose from 500 to 4000. They sold the gym in 2001. During their
        ownership of Southview Athletic Club, they worked for a consulting firm focused on improving under-performing
        athletic clubs across the United States. They developed the idea for Arcade Fitness after surveying the
        expectations that long-term members of large gyms had for their fitness clubs.
